This application was created to generate a html file once the user inputs the relevant information. This application included employee cards for a developer team such as the engineer, the manager and the intern. It also gave the option of adding more employees if necessary. Tests were ran using dummy data to ensure that the application would catch errors such as incorrect ID's, no emails inserted etc.
